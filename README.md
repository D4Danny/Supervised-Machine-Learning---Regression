# Supervised-Machine-Learning--Regression
Regression Analysis is a tool that uses data on relevant variables to develop a prediction equation or model. It generates an equation to describe the statistical relationship between a dependent variable (response) and one or more independent variable (predictor) to predict new observation. Regression Analysis + Correlation = Predict future performance using past results.

Simple linear regression is useful for finding relationship between TWO CONTINUES VARIABLES. One is predictor or independent variable and other is response or dependent variable.
In Simple Linear regression, a single variable “X” is used to predict “Y”.

#### Business Case and Prediction using Simple Linear Regression Algorithm.

### Case 1.[Prediction-for-Delivery-Time](https://github.com/D4Danny/Prediction-for-Delivery-Time/blob/main/Prediction%20for%20Delivery%20Time.ipynb)
Predict Delivery Time using Sorting time by building a Simple Linear Regression Model and performing EDA and necessary transformations. Select the best model using Python.



### Case 2.[Prediction-for-Salary-Hike](https://github.com/D4Danny/Predict-Salary-Hike/blob/main/Prediction%20Model%20for%20Salary%20Hike%20revised.ipynb)
Build a prediction model for Salary hike by performing EDA and do necessary transformations and select the best model using Python.





### 2. Multiple Linear Regression. <a name="MLR"></a>
Multiple linear regression refers to a statistical technique that uses TWO OR MORE INDEPENDENT VARIABLES to predict the outcome of a dependent variable. 

#### Business Case and Prediction using Multiple Linear Regression Algorithm.

### Case 1. [Profit-Prediction-for-Startup-Business](https://github.com/D4Danny/Profit-Prediction-for-Startup-Business/blob/main/50%20Startups%20Prediction.ipynb)
Prepare a prediction model for profit of 50_startups data based on their spends on Administration, Research and Marketing . Do transformations for getting better predictions of profit and make a table containing R^2 value for each prepared model.


### Case 2.[Price-Prediction-for-Toyota-Cars](https://github.com/D4Danny/Price-Prediction-for-Toyota-Cars/blob/main/Price%20prediction%20model%20for%20Toyota%20Corolla%20Cars.ipynb)
A large Toyota Car delaership rolled out USED CARS exchange offer for a new car. To ensure a reasonable profit, the dealer needs to be able to predict the price that the dealership will get for used cars. DATA were collected on all previous sales of used Toyota cars at the dealership. We have a dataset of 1000 Plus cars






### 3. Logistic Regression. <a name="LR"></a>
Logistic regression is a classification algorithm, that is used where the response variable is categorical.

The qualitative data may include binary response, which can always be codes as having TWO values, 0 or 1. Rather than predicting these two values, we try to model the probabilities that the response takes one of these two values.

The whole idea behind logistic regression is to find a relationship between features and probability of particular outcome.

#### Business Case and Prediction using Logistic Regression Algorithm.

### Case 1.[Term-Deposit-Prediction-for-a-Bank](https://github.com/D4Danny/Term-Deposit-Prediction-for-a-Bank/blob/main/Bank%20Customer%20Term%20Deposit.ipynb)
We have a dataset of more than 40K customers from a bank. The bank would like to know the probability or Likelyhood of their customers availing a TERM DEPOSIT based on various individual characteristics.

We used LOGISTIC REGRESSION, a Supervised Machine Learning classification algorithm to predict the probability based on various categorical dependent features.
